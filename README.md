Task 1: API Integration 

As part of my internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS PVT. LTD., I worked on Task 1, which involved integrating a public API into a responsive webpage. The goal was to fetch live data from an external source and display it dynamically on the front end. I selected the Random User API for this task, which provides randomly generated user details including name, gender, email, phone number, country, and profile picture.

I created a structured layout using HTML, styled the interface with CSS, and made it responsive for different screen sizes. I applied visual enhancements like background images, color gradients, shadow effects, and hover transitions to make the UI clean and modern. To improve readability over the background image, I used a semi-transparent dark overlay using the ::before pseudo-element in CSS.

The main logic was implemented using JavaScript, where I wrote an asynchronous function using async/await to fetch user data from the API. The data received in JSON format was parsed and displayed on the webpage using DOM manipulation. A button was also implemented to fetch and load a new random user on click, without reloading the page.

For development, I used Visual Studio Code as my code editor and Live Server to preview the webpage in real-time during testing. All project files — including index.html, styles.css, script.js, and bg.jpg — were organized in a single folder to keep the structure clean and manageable.

Tools and Technologies Used:

Languages: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)

API: Random User API (https://randomuser.me/api/)

Editor: Visual Studio Code

Extension: Live Server

Browser: Google Chrome (for testing)

This task is applicable in various real-world scenarios such as user dashboards, social media feeds, CRM systems, and web apps that rely on external data sources. Completing this task helped me strengthen my skills in API consumption, asynchronous JavaScript, and building responsive user interfaces.
